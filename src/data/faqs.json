    "question": "What does a typical session look like?",
    "answer": "The first appointment will be an initial assessment lasting 50 minutes. During this time we will gather information about why you’re presenting to therapy, any difficulties you’re currently facing, a historical and family background, as well as your hopes for therapy. From this we will have a better understanding of the issues we’re working with and which therapeutic approach is best. We can then proceed with standard sessions on a weekly or fortnightly basis. It’s usually best to stick to the same date and time for each session. Sessions will typically last 50 minutes for an individual session, or 90 minutes for couples and families."

    "question": "How long will I need to be in therapy?",
    "answer": "Therapy can be as long or short as needed, depending on the individual’s circumstances. Short to medium therapy can be anything from 4 to 16 sessions. Longer term therapy may be several months long. This is something that will be discussed after the assessment process. There is no obligation to remain in therapy if you are not finding it beneficial, therefore you can end at any time. However, planning your ending is an important part of the therapeutic process, therefore I would recommend giving ample time in order to do this well."

    "question": "How does online therapy work?",
    "answer": "Thanks to technological advances, the demand for online therapy is growing rapidly. There may be scheduling or geographical reasons that make attending a physical appointment difficult, which is where online therapy comes in handy. It works in a similar way to face-to-face therapy, with the exception being you can access this from the comfort of your own home. All you will need is some privacy, a computer with webcam facilities and a stable internet connection. Sessions remain confidential and secure and will not be recorded."
