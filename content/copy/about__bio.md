Dr Victoria Uwannah - Counselling Psychologist

Registered by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).

As a Counselling Psychologist, my aim is to come alongside you to bring clarity, compassion and understanding which will help propel you towards change. Having worked within the NHS and private sector for over 10 years, I have a wealth of experience which includes working with adults, young people, families and couples. These settings have included Psychiatric hospitals, Forensics, Community Mental Health Teams, Talking Therapies, and a specialist Personality Disorder service. I also have experience of working in schools delivering therapy to young people, facilitating workshops and providing psychoeducational training for teachers. I have also delivered Parenting courses to private organisations.

I’m passionate about bringing Psychology to the masses and connecting with prospective clients in a way that is completely down-to-earth and relatable, yet professional and effective. I like to bring the human nature to any therapeutic interaction; it doesn’t need to be all doom and gloom, therapy can be a time of curiosity and hilarity as well as deep revelation and sobriety.

Therapy can take many approaches. As a Counselling Psychologist I am trained in several therapy modalities such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, Mentalisation Based Therapy (MBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT). I also draw on Mindfulness and Relaxation techniques.
