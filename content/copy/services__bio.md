Therapy is a dedicated time to explore, understand and challenge certain thoughts, emotions and behaviours with an experienced professional. It requires commitment and investment which is not always an easy journey, but an important one. Therapy typically can cover the following areas:

- Personality Disorders (Borderline, OCD, Narcissistic, Antisocial)
- Stress
- Grief/Loss
- Emotional dysregulation
- Self-esteem
- Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Self-harm
- Suicidality
- Parenting
- Attachment difficulties
- Complex Trauma

I provide both face-to-face in Reading and London; for clinic location please see details below. I also online therapy which can be accessed internationally, at a time and place convenient for you.

I also provide psychoeducational workshops on mental wellbeing, parenting and building resilient children. If you would like to host a workshop for your particular organisation, please enquire for further information.
